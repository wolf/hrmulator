"""
Memory in Human Resource Machine is represented as numbered tiles on the
floor.  They can also have textual labels.  If tile 5 is labeled 'hello', then
your program can `copy_to hello` and it will do the same thing as `copy_to 5`.
You make this happen with `label_tile`:

    >>> m = Memory()
    >>> m[5] = 74
    >>> m[5]
    74
    >>> m.label_tile(5, label='index') # keyword for demonstration only
    >>> m['index']
    74

You don't have to call `label_tile` individually for every label you wish to
apply.  You can label them all at once by passing in a dictionary at
`__init__` time.  E.g.,

    >>> m = Memory(labels={'index':5, 'zero':9})

You can put initial values onto the tiles as well:

    >>> m = Memory(
    ...     labels={'index':5, 'zero':9},
    ...     values={'index':74, 'zero':0}
    ... )
    >>> m['zero']
    0

Normally, this constructor is all you care about since the game predefines
the contents of memory, and you predefine the labels.  You don't otherwise
interact directly with memory, `Instruction`s do that.  Everything else is
useful to you in the debugger when you actually want to change things.

The Human Resource Machine also implements "indirect" memory access, so, for
instance, if memory tile 5 contains 74, you can get and set the value in
memory tile 74 _through_ tile 5, like so:

    >>> m.get('index')
    74
    >>> m.set('index', 'C', indirect=True)
    >>> m[74]
    'C'
    >>> m.get('index', indirect=True)
    'C'

Trying to indirect through a letter raises an exception, even if you happen to
have labeled a tile with that letter.  Sorry, but that's how the game works.
Example:

    >>> m.get(74, indirect=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    hrmulator.Memory.CantIndirectThroughLetter: A letter does not address any tile.

The only things you can put onto a memory tile are integers and single characters (letters).

    >>> m['index'] = 3.14
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    hrmulator.Memory.CantStoreBadType: A memory tile may only hold an integer or a single character.

You are not allowed to read from an empty tile.  Sorry, but again---that's how
the game works:

    >>> m[3]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    hrmulator.Memory.MemoryTileIsEmptyError: (3, 'Tile 3 is empty.')

Of course I don't support slices.  The game doesn't use them, so I don't need them.

    Implements the floor-tile storage-system from Human Resource Machine.

    Does this with two member variables: `tiles`, a dictionary of the actual
    values stored (dictionary because it's sparse); and `label_map` which maps
    names to indices.  The keys in the label map are all non-numeric strings.
    The values are all integers.  The keys in the `tiles` dictionary are all
    integers.

    For an end-user, the most important methods are the constructor, which
    allows them to construct memory with values and labels already in place;
    and `label_tile`, for labeling tiles after construction-time.  The getters
    and setters are really for use by Instructions.  `debug_print` is used by
    the debugger.
